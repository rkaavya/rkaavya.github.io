## 5.1 Notes
- UAVs and Drones are used in search and rescue
- Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure
- Innovations help save money for employers but also help out customers in many different ways
- Coding gives us dopamine when we get code right or if it works
- In order to successfully update or upgrade a system, the update/upgrade must work and the customer must be happy with it

## 5.2 Notes
- Poorer and rural areas in American do not have much access to technology
- Some countries may have restricted access to the internet such as China
- Some people may have less access to updates so they may be working on older generations of computers
- Some religious groups choose not to use technology
- In our classroom, blockers and routers restrict our access to the internet

## 5.3 Notes
- There is inentional or purposeful bias in some computer websites
- Tiktok gives he For You page that is biased towards what you like to watch or what it percieves of you
- Facebook gives you people to follow based on who your friends are

- Netflix puts a bias into what certain people want to watch
- This bias can be good or bad depending on the situation

## 5.4 Notes
- Crowdsourcing is the ability to obtain shared information, to share informaion, and to participate in distributed computing with other people
- Wikipedia is an example of crowdsourcing where anyone can add information to the site
- Cryptocurrency and associated block chain are also examples of crowdsourcing
- Block chain algorithms are more garnered towards crowdsourcing private data such as medical records
- COVID data is also crowdsourcing because data analysts share a lot of information are to where cases are high and how many cases are reported in a certain area
- APIs are a way to obtain data through crowdsourcing
- Forking a repository on Github is also crowdsourcing

## 5.5 Notes
- Many lawyers make a profession on Patents and how they can be impacted on GPL (General Public Licensing)
- Qualcomm makes money on patents
- Open Source says any derivative work is free and code should be shared
- Creative Commons CC0 Public Domain Dedication waives copyright interest on a work and didcates it to world-wide public domain
- Open Source MIT License allows using code freely and making and distributing closed source versions
- GNA GPLv3 doesn't allow the distributing of closed source versions
- Need to comply to terms of licenses because it is a legality

## 5.6 Notes
- PII is Personal Identifiable Information
- Things that would be known by everyone should be on PII but don't add anything that is too personal
- Multifactor authentication required you to enter a code 
- Fingerprint or facial recognition
- Malware is sent in attachments to things in email and they request you to click on a link that sends a virus to your computer
- Phishing is where unknown sourced try to entice you and makes you clikc on a link, they impersonate companies
- Symmetric encryption is where only 1 key (secret key) is used to encrypt and decrypt electronic info
- Assymetric cryptography (publick-key cryptography) uses pari of related keys (1 public and 1 provate) to encrypt and decrypt a message and protect it from unauthorized use/access
- SSL uses both assympetric and symmetric encryption
- Phishing makes you get a virus on your computer and is a way to get you to input your PII

## DAT-1 University Faculty Lecture
- If binary # ends in 0, then decimal value must be even
- 2^# of bits = # of values
- RGB
- Additive color model where red, green, and blue light are added together to make colors
- Basic idea in computers to represent intensity of each color using a #
- Steganography
- Practive of concealing a message w/in another message or physical object
- To hide a message in a digital pic, we need to change some bits in the pic
- 8 bit RGB image can rep more than 16 mil colors
- Use LSB of red component of each pixel to store 1 bit of an 8-bit ASCII character

## IOC-1 University Faculty Lecture
- Computing and CS are changing the world in every country, state, etc.
- Change is accelerating, computing is faster, cheaper, bigger due to cloud computing than prallel/distributed
- CS is study of automating algorithmic processes that scale
- Not limited to programming
- Not limited to science, tech, eng, math
- COmputing innovations can have consequences
- 276 mil smartphone users in US
- Smartphones are supercomputers and are significantly powerful
- Poverty is diff by region, race, ethnicity, ect
- Access to internet is diff in diff areas around the world
- COVID-19 exposes why access to internet is human right
- 2016 UN affirmed Internet as important component of human rights
- Siri/Alexa ar computer programs and are machine learning individ and at scale
- Machine learning and deep learning drives AI today
- Training and learning from huge amts of data also drives AI
