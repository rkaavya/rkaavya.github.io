# Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing
Benefits: Helps explore the world, Helps share information quickly, Helps people and devices communicate with each other
Harmful Effects: Prevents people from socializing in person, Computing information may be false, Strains eyes from too much screen time

# Dopamine
The dopamine issues are real. People do get dopamine from playing video games or achieving things because these things make them happy. Everyone has a different dopamine release because different things make different people happy. Parents can affect that dopamine release because the pressure put on kids can cause a negative environment. I have no barriers preventing my study habits and success in high school

# Digital Empowerment
Someone empowers themselves in a digital world by creating something unique or achieving mastery in computing something. Someone who is empowered can help someone who is not empowered through collaboration. If they work together as a team, they can help each other. Paper or red tape may block digital empowerment. There is a barrier at Del Norte for students who do not have access to computers or software. These barriers can exist anywhere where students don't have access to computers.

# HP Computers and Racism
I think that the owner of the computer thought this was intentional becuase there is no possible way that the computer can stop following a human face just because of skin color unless the maker programmed it to specifically not pick up certain skin colors. I think that the way facial recognition works is by identifying facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, etc. (as seen in Apple phones with face id) and not by skin color. This is harmful because it can cause offense to certain groups of people. I think this was meant to be harmful because if an Apple iPhone face id can work without discriminating race, then the maker of the HP computer obviously coded for the face recognition software to exclude certain skin colors. I think that this should be corrected so that the HP computer can recognize every person's face regardless of race. o make a better outcome, I would create a facial recognition software that checked for facial features and not skin color, or by creating a software that identifies faces or the presence of a human by detecting body temperature.

# Crowdsourcing
Using slack or discord is a good way to crowdsource between the students in AP CSP because it allows us to communicate and collaborate with each other very efficiently when we are outside of the classroom environment, and it allows us to communicate with students from different class periods who we don't normally see in our classes. Crowdsourcing is used in Del Norte through instagram. ASB gets information around about school evens to students very quickly through instagram, and for those who do not have social media, the announcements that occur everyday are a good use of crowdsourcing. Our final project could be better with crwodsourcing since we would be able to get information out to people who either want to watch lacrosse games or try out for the lacross team.
