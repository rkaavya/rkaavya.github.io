    <h2>Dopamine</h2>
    <p>THe dopamine issues are real. People do get dopamine from playing video games or achieving things because these things make them happy. Everyone has a different dopamine release because different things make different people happy. Parents can affect that dopamine release because the pressure put on kids can cause a negative environment. I have no barriers preventing my study habits and success in high school</p>

    <h3>Digital Empowerment</h3>
    <p>Someone empowers themselves in a digital world by creating something unique or achieving mastery in computing something.</p>
    <p>Someone who is empowered can help someone who is not empowered through collaboration. If they work together as a team, they can help each other.</p>
    <p>Paper or red tape may block digital empowerment. There is a barrier at Del Norte for students who do not have access to computers or software. These barriers can exist anywhere where students don't have access to computers.</p>
